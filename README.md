# E-commerce System

This Java project demonstrates the implementation of obejct oriented programming concepts, including inheritance, interfaces, classes, and Java Collections. An E-commerce system (like Amazon) sells various types of products to registered customers. Customers order a product they like, and the system ships it to them. This system keeps track of all its products, all its registered customers, all current orders and all shipped orders.
